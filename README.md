A minimal, cross-platform Time Tracking App made with C++ & Qt

Build with CMake

#### NOTE: 

Qt projects built with CMake might have build issues related to the include of to-be-generated Qt' ui files
If so, you'll find the ui_*.h files in your /out/build folder that is generated at every CMake launch 
(you can restart VS, this will clean and reload CMake and generate the correct files)
